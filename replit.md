## Recent Changes (October 17, 2025)

### Latest Updates (5:35 PM)
1. **ðŸ”§ Critical Fix - Accepted Chats Now Show Immediately**: Fixed issue where agents couldn't see accepted chats until page refresh:
   - Created new endpoint `/api/agents/me` for agents to fetch their own information
   - Agents can now properly identify themselves and see their assigned chats in real-time
   - WebSocket updates now work correctly when chats are accepted
   - No more page refresh needed - chats appear instantly when accepted

### Previous Updates (5:30 PM)
1. **Premium Animations Implemented**: Added Framer Motion for polished, enterprise-grade animations:
   - Conversation cards: Smooth hover lift effect with scale transform (translateY -2px on hover)
   - Message bubbles: Gentle slide-in from bottom with fade and scale (0.3s cubic-bezier easing)
   - Loading skeletons: Animated pulse skeletons replacing static loading states
   - List animations: AnimatePresence with stagger effects for conversation lists
   - Button animations: Smooth hover scale and active state transitions
   - Custom CSS utilities: hover-lift, hover-scale, btn-smooth classes for consistent animations
2. **Unique Chat IDs Added**: Each conversation now has a unique sequential chat ID (chatId field) for admin visibility and reporting purposes. Sequential numbers like #001, #002, etc.
3. **Animation Delays Removed**: Messages now appear instantly without fade-in animations. Changed scroll behavior from "smooth" to "auto" for immediate message display.
4. **Website Widget Typing Indicators Fixed**: 
   - Widget now sends typing events when customer types
   - Widget listens for and displays agent/AI typing indicators
   - Bidirectional typing indicators fully functional
5. **Sound Notifications Verified**: Doorbell and message beep sounds confirmed working (no changes needed).

### Latest Fixes (5:00 PM)
1. **Agent Monitoring Features Fixed**:
   - "View Details" button now works - shows agent's conversations with metrics
   - "Transfer" button now works for all active chats (open, pending_acceptance, assigned)
   - Admin can transfer any conversation except resolved ones
   
2. **Agent View Corrected**: Agents can NO longer see AI-handled conversations (status: "open"). They only see:
   - Pending acceptance chats (with Accept button for 30 seconds)
   - Chats assigned to them
3. **Tabs Simplified for Agents**: Agents only see "All" and "Assigned" tabs. Admin sees all tabs (All, Open, Assigned, Resolved).
4. **Escalation Flow Fixed**: Escalation uses 30-second pending_acceptance window. All agents see and can accept within 30 seconds.

### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **Agent Filtering Logic Fixed**: Resolved chats are now properly hidden from agents (only visible to admin). Pending acceptance chats correctly disappear from agent view after 30 seconds.
2. **Tab Filtering Implemented**: Conversation tabs (All, Open, Assigned, Resolved) now properly filter conversations. Resolved tab only visible to admin.
3. **Real-time WebSocket Updates**: Fixed query invalidation so conversations and messages auto-update without manual refresh.
4. **Chat Input Disabled for Resolved Chats**: Agents cannot send messages to resolved conversations.

### Features Verified
1. **Accept Chat Button**: Fully functional for pending_acceptance chats within 30-second window (first-accept-first-serve).
2. **Sound Notifications**: Doorbell sound for new escalated chats, beep sound for incoming messages - already implemented.
3. **AI Knowledge Base Integration**: AI receives knowledge base text and file metadata for all providers (OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter).
4. **AI Conversation Memory**: Last 5 messages maintained in context for coherent multi-turn dialogues.
5. **Typing Indicators**: Real-time typing indicators for customer, agent, and AI.
6. **Agent Monitoring Dashboard**: Admin can view real-time agent activity and manually transfer chats between agents.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React 18 and TypeScript, using Vite for development and bundling. Wouter handles client-side routing, and TanStack Query manages server state. UI components are developed using Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives for accessibility, styled with Tailwind CSS, and support light/dark modes. The design emphasizes information density and productivity, akin to Intercom and Zendesk. React Query manages server state with WebSocket integration for real-time updates.

### Backend Architecture

The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript and Node.js, featuring a RESTful API and a WebSocket server for real-time communication. Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL is used for type-safe database operations, supported by Zod for runtime validation. An in-memory storage (MemStorage) acts as an abstraction layer for data. The database schema includes `conversations`, `messages`, `agents`, `tickets` (with unique sequential IDs), `ai_settings`, `users`, `knowledge_files`, `email_settings`, and `csat_ratings` tables, along with a PostgreSQL sequence for ticket numbers.

### AI Integration Layer

The platform features a multi-provider AI architecture supporting OpenAI, Google Gemini, and OpenRouter (with free models like DeepSeek V3), with a unified interface for response generation. It includes configurable system prompts and knowledge base injection. The AI automatically receives metadata from uploaded knowledge files (filenames and upload dates) in its context, enabling it to reference available resources when responding to customers. The AI handles initial customer messages, and an intelligent escalation system automatically detects when human intervention is needed, assigning conversations to available agents or creating tickets with defined TATs.

**Note on Knowledge File Text Extraction**: Currently, the AI receives file names and metadata but cannot automatically extract text from PDF, Excel, or Word documents. For full text extraction, install these packages: `pdf-parse` (for PDFs), `xlsx` (for Excel), and `mammoth` (for Word documents). Admins can manually add key information from these files to the Knowledge Base text field as a workaround.

### System Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (Admin/Agent) with protected routes and server-side authorization using Passport.js.
- **Channel Integration**: Supports Web Chat Widget, WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, and Twitter with platform-specific authentication and auto-webhook registration.
- **30-Second Auto-Assignment**: When AI escalates a conversation, it enters "pending_acceptance" status with a 30-second window. All available agents can see and accept the chat (first-accept-first-serve). After 30 seconds, the chat is hidden from agents but remains visible to admin for manual assignment. Includes sound notifications (doorbell for new chats, beep for messages).
- **Smart Chat Transfer**: When admin transfers a chat to another agent, the previous agent loses visibility. Agents only see: (1) open chats handled by AI, (2) pending acceptance chats within 30 seconds, (3) chats specifically assigned to them. Admin sees all chats.
- **AI Conversation Memory**: AI maintains context of the last 5 messages in each conversation for all providers (OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter), enabling coherent multi-turn dialogues.
- **Ticket Management**: Features unique ticket numbers, issue details, internal notes, priority, TAT, and status management (create, edit, re-open, filter).
- **Knowledge Base**: Allows file uploads (documents, PDFs, images) with management UI, storing files as data URLs.
- **Email Notifications**: Integrates with SendGrid for configurable email notifications on ticket creation, resolution, and CSAT survey distribution.
- **CSAT Management**: Collects customer satisfaction ratings (1-5 stars) with automated thank-you messages, and provides an admin dashboard for analytics and feedback.
- **Export & Analytics**: An admin-only page for exporting conversation data to CSV, with advanced filtering and message analytics.
- **Agent Monitoring Dashboard**: Admin-only page displaying real-time agent activity including: (1) which agent is handling which customer, (2) active chat counts per agent, (3) handling time tracking per conversation and agent, (4) manual chat transfer functionality to reassign conversations to any available agent. When a chat is transferred, the previous agent immediately loses visibility.
